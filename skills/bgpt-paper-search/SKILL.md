name: bgpt-paper-search
description: Search scientific papers and retrieve structured experimental data extracted from full-text studies via the BGPT MCP server. Returns 25+ fields per paper including methods, results, sample sizes, quality scores, and conclusions. Use for literature reviews, evidence synthesis, and finding experimental details not available in abstracts alone.
license: MIT
compatibility: Requires the BGPT MCP server configured in the agent host (npx mcp-remote or npx bgpt-mcp), internet access to bgpt.pro, and an optional BGPT API key for paid usage.

# BGPT Paper Search

## Overview

BGPT is a remote MCP server that searches a curated database of scientific papers built from raw experimental data extracted from full-text studies. Unlike traditional literature databases that return titles and abstracts, BGPT returns structured data from the actual paper content — methods, quantitative results, sample sizes, quality assessments, and 25+ metadata fields per paper.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Searching for scientific papers with specific experimental details
- Conducting systematic or scoping literature reviews
- Finding quantitative results, sample sizes, or effect sizes across studies
- Comparing methodologies used in different studies
- Looking for papers with quality scores or evidence grading
- Needing structured data from full-text papers (not just abstracts)
- Building evidence tables for meta-analyses or clinical guidelines

## Setup

BGPT is a remote MCP server — no local installation required. Configure it in your agent's MCP settings before use; this skill instructs the agent to call the `search_papers` MCP tool and does not enable MCP access by itself.

### Claude Desktop / Claude Code

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bgpt": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://bgpt.pro/mcp/sse"]
    }
  }
}
```

### npm (alternative)

```bash
npx bgpt-mcp
```

## Usage

Once the BGPT MCP server is configured, call its `search_papers` tool via the agent's MCP interface (not via Bash):

```
Search for papers about: "CRISPR gene editing efficiency in human cells"
```

The server returns structured results including:
- **Title, authors, journal, year, DOI**
- **Methods**: Experimental techniques, models, protocols
- **Results**: Key findings with quantitative data
- **Sample sizes**: Number of subjects/samples
- **Quality scores**: Study quality assessments
- **Conclusions**: Author conclusions and implications

## Pricing

- **Free tier**: 50 searches per network, no API key required
- **Paid**: $0.01 per result with an API key from [bgpt.pro/mcp](https://bgpt.pro/mcp)

## When NOT to use
- General web search or abstract-only literature lookups.
- Tasks without the BGPT MCP server configured.

## Inputs
A research question or query; BGPT MCP server configured; optional filters (year, study type).

## Core workflow
1. Confirm BGPT MCP is configured (see Setup).
2. Search with specific experimental terms.
3. Read structured fields (methods, sample size, results, quality score).
4. Compare studies and cite them.

## Edge cases and failure handling
- No results -> broaden terms, drop filters.
- Free-tier limits reached -> see Pricing; batch queries.

## Validation
- Each cited paper has its fields (methods, n, result) recorded; claims match the extracted data.

## Output requirements
Table of papers with key fields and a short synthesis with citations.

## Example
```text
Query "CRISPR off-target sequencing sample size" -> table of studies with n and effect sizes.
```
